        <p>The <a id="georgia-folklife-project" href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/south-central-georgia-folklife-project/about-this-collection/"><em>South-Central Georgia Folklife Project </em></a><a href="#reference1"><sup>1</sup></a> was produced as a joint effort between the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress and the Arts Experiment Station of Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College (ABAC) in Tifton, Georgia. The collection contains nearly 25,000 items,<sup><a href="#reference2">2</sup></a> among which is an oral history which recently captured my attention. It was an hour of audio with my great-grandfather.</p>

        <p>In the summer of 1977, the American Folklife Center dispatched 6 fieldworkers to canvas 8 counties in south Georgia— Ben Hill, Berrien, Colquitt, Cook, Irwin, Tift, Turner, and Worth. Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tift county, neatly situated at the epicenter of the chosen region, served as the project's headquarters.</p>

        <p>At the time, the American Folklife Center was newly founded, tasked by Congress the previous year "to preserve and present American Folklife." Likewise, the Arts Experiment Station at ABAC was  established only the year before with a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts. Its mission was to “focus on the cultural assets and needs of South Georgia communities.” These new groups collaborated to perform the ethnographic field research which comprises the project collection.</p>

        <p>They gathered all sorts of materials over six weeks, documenting the culture by interviewing residents for oral histories, taking photos, attending church sermons, even drinking moonshine with locals.</p>

        <p>As I was scanning oral histories in the collection, my great-grandfather’s name popped out – Jack Dempsey. Initially, I couldn’t be sure it was him. There was nothing in the metadata to verify it, and I wouldn't trust myself to identify the voice. So I scrubbed into the audio and listened a beat. Hearing references to barbeque added weight to my hunch. My family tells me he ran a barbeque establishment around that time in that area. How many Jack Dempseys could fit that bill in a town of 15,000 people? Sure enough— more listening (and cross-referencing with my mother) confirmed it was him.
        </p>

        <p>The fieldworker who interviewed Dempsey and took several photos of the store was David Stanley— a man in his mid-thirties from the University of Texas at Austin. Stanley wrote rich field notes, describing Dempsey as a “colorful character” who took pride in his one-man barbeque operation.<sup><a href="#reference4">4</a></sup> This is evident in the following audio from their third interview, which appears to be the only one recorded. </p>

        <p>It occurred on Tuesday—July 26th, 1977. I trimmed the interview from an hour to about thirty minutes, but if you prefer the raw, unedited source, I’ve linked it in the references below. For the hasty listeners, I will also include timestamps to indicate a change of subject in the conversation— that way you can skip ahead. </p>

        <p>Much of the dialogue contains folkish insights for historians to mine. For instance, Dempsey’s casual mention of capital punishment initially feels out of place, but becomes clear when contextualized. The topic happened to be hotly controversial at the time. </p>

        <p>In 1972 the Supreme Court reduced all pending death sentences to life imprisonment in the case <em>Furman v. Georgia</em>. In a 5-4 decision, the Court held that Georgia’s death penalty statute could result in arbitrary sentencing due to the complete sentencing discretion held by the jury. As a policy, capital punishment was nullified as “cruel and unusual” under the 8th amendment, until such time that state criminal statutes could ensure the penalty was not applied arbitrarily or discriminatorily.

        <p>Georgia reached the Court again in 1976, a year before Dempsey’s interview. By this time the state had revised its statues to limit jury discretion. These revisions satisfied the Court, which affirmed the constitutionality of capital punishment under the eighth amendment in <em>Gregg v. Georgia</em>, again opening the door for executions.</p>

        <p>This back and forth meant the issue was part of the political conversation at the time. It would make sense for Dempsey to state his position, especially since it served to preface his monologue on the state of America— a country he described as having “overslept.”</p>

        <p>“I believe in law and order above anything," he said. If the death penalty were abolished, in his view, the thugs, thieves, gangsters, and outlaws would overwhelm the penetentiaries such that criminals would be “so close” to apartment houses and homes “that it'll be miserable to live.”</p>

        <p>Another timely comment indirectly references desegregation— or, by another token, forced integration — in the school system. Dempsey stated— “I think each neighborhood knows its situation better than anybody. I don’t ever believe we’ll ever have an educational system that’ll work like we’ve had for the last few years. Because anything that’s forced on you, that causes a bitterness and a hatred. And I don’t think anything will work successfully under those circumstances.” </p>

        <p>Other, non-political stories that warrant highlighting include Dempsey’s former boss in Texas, who he described as a “hellcat on wheels”; a 115-year old black man dying of tuberculosis, with arms he described as “no wider than mop handles”; and losing “every nickel and dime” farming Minnesota’s Red River Valley. </p>

        <p>Big thanks to Todd Harvey, a reference librarian at the American Folklife Center, for helping me navigate the Library of Congress archives.</p>
