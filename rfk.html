    <hr>

        <p>The first time I ever saw RFK Jr speak was in-person at the Lincoln memorial on Sunday, January 23, 2022. He was giving the keynote address at a rally called <em>"Defeat the Mandates: An American Homecoming."</em> To reorient you in that moment, this was the stretch of time when the Omicron variant was causing a surge of Covid cases in the United States. Many cities and states mandated that residents receive a Covid-19 vaccine.</p>

        <p>In the days leading up to the rally, my girlfriend Anysja and I went camping with our dogs in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The weather was chilly that weekend, with temperatures dipping as low as 9 degrees (F) in the wee hours of Sunday. Despite the cold, though, I was in a cheery mood; partly because one of my closest friends had just gotten engaged, and partly because I was excited to watch another controversial political rally unfold in the nation's capital. A year had passed since Anysja and I witnessed the events of January 6, 2021.</p>

        <p>We left Harper's Ferry just after 11am. Two and a half hours later, after dropping off the dogs at home in Arlington, we arrived at the Lincoln memorial. The area was teeming with a crowd of at least a couple thousand people, and we couldn‚Äôt find anywhere to park. The march from the Washington monument had already concluded, and the crowd was then listening to a lineup of speakers, none of whom I had heard of except RFK Jr. </p>

        <p>Anysja knew I didn‚Äôt want to miss his speech, so she volunteered to drop me off and park across the bridge at Arlington National Cemetery. Afterward, she would make her way back on foot to meet me.</p>

        <p>If you saw any mainstream news articles or social media posts following the event, they likely soured your impression of RFK Jr, or at least attempted to. CNN‚Äôs article was headlined "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/23/politics/robert-f-kennedy-nazi-germany-offensive-anti-vaccine-speech/index.html">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. invokes Nazi Germany in offensive anti-vaccine speech</a>." The article claimed that speakers at the rally "showcased several bigoted comparisons to the Holocaust" and narrowed in on a distasteful comment RFK Jr. made about Anne Frank (for which he later <a target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/25/robert-kennedy-anne-frank-remarks-00002055">apologized</a>). Social media accounts also cited the quote as evidence that RFK Jr. is a crank.</p>

        <div class="center">
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every family has a crazy. RFK Jr is his family&#39;s.<br><br>&quot;Even in Hitler Germany (sic), you could, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland. You could hide in an attic, like Anne Frank did,&quot; said Kennedy in a speech at the Lincoln Memorial on Sunday.</p>&mdash; Grandma Anti-Trumper üåäüåäüåäüåä (@Carolyn81933632) <a href="https://twitter.com/Carolyn81933632/status/1485979453268246528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

        <div class="center">
          <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m always disgusted by the comparisons between the Holocaust and vaccines.

        </div>

        <p>The news article I found more interesting was the Washington Post‚Äôs, which had a less sensational headline‚Äî"<a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/23/dc-anti-vaccine-rally-mandates-protest/">Anti-vaccine activists march in D.C.‚Äîa city that mandates coronavirus vaccination‚Äîto protest mandates</a>." In particular, the article touched on something I noticed while people-watching at the rally. </p>

        <blockquote>‚ÄúSome were white-haired; others were being pushed in strollers. Most were White and many wore gear with slogans supporting former president Donald Trump.‚Äù</blockquote>

        <p>The demographics of the crowd are precisely what I found most interesting about the rally. Because I had seen first-hand who showed up for January 6, I had a good understanding of how the crowds compared. I saw some overlap, but also significant differences. Given that RFK Jr. is now running against former President Trump in 2024, I think it's important to examine this overlap and contrast between their bases of support.</p>

        <p>(It is worth noting that there were several speakers at Defeat the Mandates, but it seemed that the majority of the attendees, if not all, braved the cold day to hear RFK Jr. speak. With this in mind, I believe that the composition of the crowd acts as an indicator for the demographic that may support RFK Jr. in his presidential campaign.)</p>

        <p>The people I saw on January 6 skewed older than the crowd at Defeat the Mandates. A sizable chunk looked to be retirees. More appeared to be blue-collar workers than not. Judging from their look and the conversations I overheard, a good proportion of them were from out-of-town. These were rural people, and they dressed the part‚Äîmany sporting camouflage, tactical jackets, and combat boots. Yellow Revolutionary War banners were all over the place.</p>

        <p>The <em>don‚Äôt tread on me</em> types were also at Defeat the Mandates, but they were more sparse, blending into a crowd which leaned middle to upper middle-class. Unlike the J6ers, these people looked local, presenting as cosmopolitan or suburban. As the Washington Post mentioned, there were a lot of kids. This event was more family-friendly, and a lot more women of child-bearing age were present than what I saw on January 6.</p>

       <p>The Washington Post article noted there was a clear presence of Donald Trump supporters among the Defeat the Mandates attendees. I, too, saw evidence for this‚ÄîAmerica First hats, Trump beanies. Just as Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016 represented a populist backlash against the political establishment from the right, RFK Jr.'s message in the political landscape of early 2022 represented a nascent populist movement challenging the political establishment from the left.</p>

       <p>His speech was first and foremost a critique of the pandemic response, but he also discussed other topics which have since become themes of his presidential campaign. He highlighted the issue of information chaos and accused the mainstream media and federal government agencies of colluding to censor alternative narratives, resulting in manipulation and misinformation. He spoke about the importance of transparency in the federal government, whose agencies, like the CDC, have sowed distrust with the American public. He also emphasized how the pandemic response contributed to an erosion of constitutional rights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech, religion, property rights, and due process.</p>

       <p>It comes as no surprise that the populist left and populist right share a common set of concerns. They both sense deep-seated problems in American society, but diverge on how to solve them. In attending January 6 and Defeat the Mandates, I couldn't help but be reminded of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements of 2010 and 2011.</p>

       <p>The Tea Party rallies clearly represented conservative-leaning political forces, focusing on issues related to taxes, government spending, and the national debt. The Occupy Wall Street rallies represented liberal-leaning political forces, focusing on issues related to economic inequality, corporate greed, and the influence of money in politics. On the whole, both were populist responses to the events and consequences of the Great Recession. Each side was aggrieved over the financial condition of the country and were fired up enough to protest in public. They shared a sense that something was wrong in America, and that these wrongs were not being addressed by the political establishment.</p>

       <!-- <p>Politicians like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren capitalized on this discontent from the left. From the right, figures like Ron and Rand Paul, and ultimately Donald Trump, also capitalized on this.</p> -->

       <p>In the same way, putting aside their dissatisfaction with the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, the J6ers and their sympathizers are conservative-leaning, but they unite with the Defeat the Mandates attendees in their mistrust of the federal government, criticism of the mainstream media, and support for alternative narratives (what some might call conspiracy theories).</p>

       <p>The Defeat the Mandates attendees shared a distrust of the federal government, Criticism of the mainstream media, and Support for  support for alternative narratives (or what some might call conspiracy theories). These are all common themes among populist movements, both on the left and the right.</p>

        <p>It remains to be seen whether RFK Jr. will be able to translate his populist appeal into electoral success. However, the Defeat the Mandates rally was a clear sign that he has a strong base of support among those who feel alienated from the political establishment.</p>
