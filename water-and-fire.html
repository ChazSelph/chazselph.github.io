    <hr>

        

        <p>Joe Biden and Xi Jinping had never met face-to-face as presidents before November 14, 2022. Hope was high for this particularly consequential relationship to benefit from an in-person conversation. After all, simple human physics adds a new dimension to personal interactions. Both men arrived at the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia fresh off political victories at home, with Xi having secured a third term at the 20th National Party Congress and Biden's Democrats having surprised observers by overperforming in the midterm elections.</p>

            <p>Just as their previous five times speaking remotely, this meeting, too, had all the airs of diplomatic headway. All hands were on deck, with each side bringing a delegation of nine officials.<sup><a href="#reference20">20</a></sup> Ultimately, though, there was little to no reconciliation on the most pressing issue of the bilateral relationship—Taiwan.</p>

       <p>Following the meeting, the White House released a high-level overview of the three hour discussion.<sup><a href="#reference1">1</a></sup> The two sentences on Taiwan gave an obligatory nod to the one China policy and then pointed blame at China for the deteriorating state of cross-strait relations.</p>


       <blockquote>
           “On Taiwan, [President Biden] laid out in detail that our one China policy has not changed, the United States opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo by either side, and the world has an interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He raised U.S. objections to the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive actions toward Taiwan, which undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the broader region, and jeopardize global prosperity.”
       </blockquote>

       <p>At face value, the above statement is clear and consistent. The status quo of abiding by the One China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act,<sup><a href="#reference14">14</a></sup> the three Joint Communiques,<sup><a href="#reference15">15</a></sup> and the Six Assurances<sup><a href="#reference13">13</a></sup> is to be honored and sustained. However, one line stands out as needing to be squared with recent developments; that "the U.S. opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo by either side."</p>

        <p>On August 2, against the wishes of the Chinese, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed in Taiwan with an official Congressional delegation. In a scathing editorial published the same day, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the circumstances like this:<sup><a href="#reference9"> 9</a></sup></p>  

        <blockquote>At present, the situation in the Taiwan Strait is facing a new round of tension and severe challenges. The fundamental reason is that the Taiwan authorities and the United States are constantly changing the status quo.</blockquote>

        <p>The Congressional Delegation led by Pelosi released a statement which acknowledged this criticism, but pushed back against the notion that their visit constituted an upset to the status quo.<sup><a href="#reference16">16</a></sup></p>

        <blockquote>“Our visit is one of several Congressional delegations to Taiwan – and it in no way contradicts longstanding United States policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, U.S.-China Joint Communiques and the Six Assurances.  The United States continues to oppose unilateral efforts to change the status quo.”</blockquote>

        <p>Mainland opposition to official U.S. personnel in Taiwan dates back to the normalization talks of 1978—talks which eventually led to the <a href="https://www.ait.org.tw/u-s-prc-joint-communique-1979/" target="_blank">Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations</a>. Then President Jimmy Carter's Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance, began negotiations with a proposal which attempted to maintain official personnel in Taiwan. Negotiating for the Chinese, Deng Xiaoping rejected the proposal as creating, in effect, a “flagless embassy.”<sup><a href="#reference17"> 17</a></sup> On August 11, 1978 the United States outlined the nature of its relations with Taiwan after normalization with the mainland: cultural, commercial, and other relations would continue, but without U.S. government representation.</p>     

       <p>Speaker Pelosi's official delegation to Taiwan lends credence to Beijing's assertion that the U.S. is violating the One-China policy by cultivating an official relationship with Taiwanese government representatives.</p>

       <p>The Chinese reaction was swift and severe. Beijing launched joint military exercises<sup><a href="#reference10">10</a></sup> around the island and suspended or canceled eight official military dialogues and cooperation channels with the United States.</p>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>Less than two weeks later, on August 14th and 15th, a second Congressional delegation led by Massachusettes Senator Ed Markey visited Taiwan to meet with "Taiwan counterparts" such as President Tsai Ing-wen, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, and members of the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee from the Legislative Yuan.<sup><a href="#reference19">19</a></sup></p>

        <p>Another event caught China's attention on a more bellicose U.S. position on Taiwan. 2) the statement Biden made during an interview in September,<sup><a href="#reference4">4</a></sup> that if mainland China invaded Taiwan, U.S. forces would be deployed to defend the island.</p>


       <blockquote>
           Scott Pelley: So unlike Ukraine, to be clear, sir, U.S. Forces, U.S. men and women would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion?<br/><br/>

            President Joe Biden: Yes.
       </blockquote>

      <!-- <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EddUGD8jcR4?start=22&amp;end=53" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->


      <p>With these developments, it appears that the U.S. is at the very least cognizant of Beijing's sincere opposition to official diplomatic relations between Taiwan and the U.S. To use the words of the White House, it isn't difficult to imagine, from a Chinese perspective, that the U.S. is taking 'increasingly aggressive actions toward Taiwan.'</p>

    <p>With the Pelosi visit to Taiwan and Biden's word to defend the island with U.S. troops in mind, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke directly to this in their readout of the Xi-Biden meeting.</p>

       <blockquote>

            [President Xi] stressed that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China’s core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations.<br/><br/>

            Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and China’s internal affair. Anyone that seeks to split Taiwan from China will be violating the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation; the Chinese people will absolutely not let that happen! <br/>

        </blockquote>

      <p>At the least it can be interpreted as a foreign party inserting itself into the internal affairs of China (this is how Beijing sees it). The readout from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs directly addresses this:</p>

    

        <blockquote>

            We hope to see, and are all along committed to, peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, but cross-Strait peace and stability and “Taiwan independence” are as irreconcilable as water and fire. We hope that the U.S. side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiqués. President Biden has said on many occasions that the United States does not support “Taiwan independence” and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the U.S. side will act on this assurance to real effect.
        </blockquote>



        <p>For China's part in recent developments, 1). a whitepaper released by the The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and The State Council Information Office. I. Taiwan Is Part of China - This Is an Indisputable Fact </p>

            <p>2) the Chinese constitution was amended at the recent 20th National Party Congress to include language against Taiwanese independence:<sup><a href="#reference5"> 5</a></sup></p>

        <blockquote>“The Party shall work continuously to strengthen the unity of all the Chinese people, including compatriots in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and in Taiwan as well as overseas Chinese. It shall promote long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, resolutely oppose and deter separatists seeking "Taiwan independence," and achieve the reunification of the motherland by fully, faithfully, and resolutely implementing the policy of One Country, Two Systems.”</blockquote>

        <p>There are three popular lines of thought among the Taiwanese: </p>

        <ul class="taiwan-ul">
            <li>maintain the status quo and decide at a later date</li>
            <li>maintain the status quo indefinitely</li>
            <li>maintain the status quo and move toward independence</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The first two positions have virtually identical support (28%), but the position to 'maintain the status quo and decide at a later date' has been trending upward and the position to maintain the status quo indefinitely has been trending downward.</p>

        <p> The third most popular position is to maintain the status quo, and move toward independence. This position is the most improbable outcome, and also the most likely posture to lead to war between China and the U.S.</p>

        <hr>


        <p>Taiwan's current ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), is traditionally independence-leaning. However, President Tsai Ing-wen has side-stepped the idea of moving toward independence by claiming that Taiwan—formally recognized as the Republic of China—is already an independent country, and that there is no need for a formal declaration of independence. </p>

        <p>There is little international appetite for recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign country. Only 13 UN members recognize Taiwan and about 59 countries have established unofficial diplomatic relations with it.<sup><a href="#reference6">6</a></sup> In contrast, the People's Republic of China has established diplomatic relations with 181 countries since its founding in 1949.<sup><a href="#reference9">9</a></sup> </p>
