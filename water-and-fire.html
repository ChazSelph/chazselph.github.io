        <p>Before November 14, 2022, Joe Biden and Xi Jinping had never met face-to-face in their roles as presidents of the United States and China. Their meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Bali, Indonesia had all the airs of diplomatic progress, but, just as in their previous 5 times speaking remotely, there was little to no reconciliation on the most pressing issue of the bilateral relationship—Taiwan.</p>

       <p>In the White House readout for the meeting,<sup><a href="#reference1">1</a></sup> the U.S. gave an obligatory nod to the one China policy and then pointed the finger at China for the deteriorating state of cross-strait relations.</p>


       <blockquote>
           “On Taiwan, [President Biden] laid out in detail that our one China policy has not changed, the United States opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo by either side, and the world has an interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He raised U.S. objections to the PRC’s coercive and increasingly aggressive actions toward Taiwan, which undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the broader region, and jeopardize global prosperity.”
       </blockquote>

       <p>At face value, the above statement is clear and consistent. But one must also square the U.S. position with a statement Biden made during an interview with 60 Minutes in September,<sup><a href="#reference4">4</a></sup> that if mainland China invaded Taiwan, U.S. forces would be deployed to defend the island.</p>

       <blockquote>
           Scott Pelley: So unlike Ukraine, to be clear, sir, U.S. Forces, U.S. men and women would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion?<br/><br/>

            President Joe Biden: Yes.
       </blockquote>

      <!-- <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EddUGD8jcR4?start=22&amp;end=53" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->


      <p>From the U.S. perspective, the status quo is to pay heed to its formal commitments—the One China policy, Six Assurances— and to maintain deliberate ambiguity toward an attack on Taiwan. However, Biden’s 60 Minutes statement upsets that status quo. This brings us to the Chinese response. How are they seeking to address Biden’s upending of the status quo?</p>

       <p>The readout from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a conscious effort toward clearing up the deliberate ambiguity of the U.S. position.<sup><a href="#reference3">3</a></sup></p>


        <blockquote>
            President Xi gave a full account of the origin of the Taiwan question and China’s principled position. He stressed that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China’s core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-U.S. relations.<br/><br/>

            Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and China’s internal affair. Anyone that seeks to split Taiwan from China will be violating the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation; the Chinese people will absolutely not let that happen! <br/><br/>

            We hope to see, and are all along committed to, peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, but cross-Strait peace and stability and “Taiwan independence” are as irreconcilable as water and fire. We hope that the U.S. side will match its words with action and abide by the one-China policy and the three joint communiqués. President Biden has said on many occasions that the United States does not support “Taiwan independence” and has no intention to use Taiwan as a tool to seek advantages in competition with China or to contain China. We hope that the U.S. side will act on this assurance to real effect.
        </blockquote>



        <p>Adding more gas to the fire, at the recent 20th National Party Congress, the Chinese constitution was amended to include language against Taiwanese independence:<sup><a href="#reference5">5</a></sup></p>

        <blockquote>“The Party shall work continuously to strengthen the unity of all the Chinese people, including compatriots in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and in Taiwan as well as overseas Chinese. It shall promote long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao, resolutely oppose and deter separatists seeking "Taiwan independence," and achieve the reunification of the motherland by fully, faithfully, and resolutely implementing the policy of One Country, Two Systems.”</blockquote>

        <p>From the perspective of the Taiwanese, there are 3 popular positions—represented by the black, blue, and green trendlines. The top two are virtually tied, but one has been trending upward and the other downward. The most popular position, in a downward trend, is to ‘maintain the status quo, and decide at a later date.’ The second most popular position, trending upward, is to ‘maintain the status quo indefinitely.’ The third most popular position is to ‘maintain the status quo, and move toward independence.’</p>

        <p>The ‘move toward independence’ position is the most improbable outcome, and the most likely to lead to war between China and the U.S. Both mainland China and Taiwan’s president—Tsi Ing-wen—are against this outcome, though Tsai Ing-wen is more nuanced. She believes that Taiwan is already an independent entity, and does not need any formal declaration of independence.</p>
