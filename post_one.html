        <p>At the time, the American Folklife Center was newly founded, tasked by Congress the previous year "to preserve and present American Folklife." Likewise, the Arts Experiment Station at ABAC was  established only the year before with a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts. Its mission was to “focus on the cultural assets and needs of South Georgia communities.” These new groups collaborated to perform the ethnographic field research which comprises the project collection.</p>


        <p>The fieldworker who interviewed Dempsey and took several photos of the store was David Stanley— a man in his mid-thirties from the University of Texas at Austin. Stanley wrote rich field notes, describing Dempsey as a “colorful character” who took pride in his one-man barbeque operation.<sup><a href="#reference4">4</a></sup> This is evident in the following audio from their third interview, which appears to be the only one recorded. </p>
