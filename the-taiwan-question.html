        <p><em>“If we can’t reunify China right away, we will do it in a century; if not in a century, then in a millennium.”</em><br/><div style="text-align:right; 
                          width: 600px;
                          max-width: 600px;

                          margin-right: auto;">--Deng Xiaoping</div></p>

        <p>There is a growing sense of confidence in China, bordering on hubris. Certainly a high degree of confidence is merited. In the last 40 years China has lifted nearly 800 million people out of poverty, a significant achievement by any measure. A China skeptic can argue against the flimsy rule of law by a single party government, and Westerners often do, but having lived on the mainland during most of 2015 I have come to accept that, by and large, the Chinese are satisfied with their political reality.</p>

        <p>Simply put, politics does not consume daily life in China the way it does in the United States. The Chinese have come a long way since Mao Zedong, and they are proud of what they have achieved in economic terms. Their country has developed into a moderately prosperous society and, accordingly, their list of grievances has shortened— unlike in the United States, where grievances have ballooned.</p>

        <p>The Chinese Communist party has sustained high growth rates ever since Deng Xiaoping began to liberalize the economy in 1979. For forty-three years onward, citizens have reaped dividends which materially improved the general welfare: first-world infrastructure, education investments, and most importantly, the satiation of hunger pangs in people who, not very long ago, commonly endured them.</p>

        <p>For many in China, the upheavals of the Mao era are not so much history as they are lived experiences. Grandparents are still alive to reinforce the narrative that things are better now than a generation ago. This appreciation manifests itself in the culture in a myriad of ways, such as the social taboo against wasting food.</p>

        <p>Of course, many of the positive developments in China are a result of globalization, a two-way street which has proved a boon to the East but has precipitated backlash in the West. In the West one finds cultural critique and resentment against economic inequality. In the East one finds gratitude, monocultural pride, and an expanding middle-class.</p>

        <p>All of this is to say, the Communist party has established a high trust relationship with many of the 1.4 billion people who abide by their decisions. I have kept in contact with a handful of these people since my stay there, and I check in every now and then. What I hear is a shared perception that, under Xi Jinping’s leadership, China is master of its destiny. All it must do is turn the page of history and seize the reins of its future. Nowhere is this seizing of destiny more apparent than in the common refrain that there is only one China.</p>

        <p>The One China doctrine dates back to the Chinese Civil War. The People’s Republic of China, aka the Communists, and the Republic of China, aka the Nationalists, each claimed sovereignty over the whole of China. There was no dispute that “Taiwan and the mainland were part of the same political entity. The disagreement was about which Chinese government was the rightful ruler.”</p>
        
        <p>Ultimately, the Nationalists failed to defeat the Communists on the mainland, but succeeded in fleeing to the periphery of China—the island of Taiwan. They established a distinct political identity which, over time, was molded into a functioning democracy. </p>

        <p>In effect the Communists consider Taiwan a “renegade province”— unfinished business from a civil war. Securing a final victory over Taiwan would conclude a chapter of history that the sons and daughters of China are eager to move beyond. </p>

        <p>For its part, the United States has recognized the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of all of China. Three communiques have underpinned this position. The Shanghai Communique of 1972 provided the initial acknowledgement that “all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of China (p480).”</p>

        <p>The second communique, which normalized relations between the two countries, was adopted on January 1, 1979.</p>

        <p>The third communique was adopted in August 1982 and specified that the United States had “no intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity,... or pursuing a policy of ‘two Chinas’ or ‘one China and one Taiwan.’” (486)</p>

        <p>Today the United States is trying to drive a wedge into the One China doctrine. On three occasions Biden has said the US would intervene militarily to defend Taiwan from a mainland assault. In effect these “gaffes” are an attempt to move the goalposts on historic commitments, a grave mistake which should be walked back. A nascent consciousness is developing in America of ‘One China and One Taiwan,’ and the United States would be wise to nip it in the bud. Americans must understand that China will not yield its ultimate will to force a successful outcome, where Beijing qualifies success as nothing less than total control over Taiwan.</p>

        <p>I polled some mainland Chinese people about the Taiwan question and, in general, about the current relationship between the United States and China. </p>

        <p>Asked to comment on the current situation with Taiwan, 31 year-old Jiang Xingxing expressed confidence in her government’s judgment. “I believe China can deal with it very well. We think Xi is a very good President. He makes China strong. A lot of our government leaders are [very good].”</p>

        <p>A university teacher in Hunan province stated “The status quo is to be maintained, neither unification nor independence.” Later, he continued, “the mainland tries to persuade Taiwan to talk about unification under One Country, Two systems”.</p>

        <p>A former student of mine simply told me “只有一个中国”— there is only one China.</p>
