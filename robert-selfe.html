    <hr>

        <p>Robert Selfe was born circa 1630 in Melksham, England— not far from the Neolithic wonders of Stonehenge and Avebury. He grew up to marry Mary Antsy, and together they voyaged to Virginia in the 1650s. Both in the prime of youth, they made new lives in foreign lands, joining the settlement of 26,070 whites and 950 blacks.<sup><a href="#reference5">5</a></sup></p>

        <p>Selfe also paid the way for 6 other people to immigrate, allowing him to capitalize on Virginia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headright" target="_blank">headright</a> law supporting immigration. The law dated to November 18, 1618 when the Virginia Company offered 50 acres per "head" for the transportation expenses of any person who settled in the colony. Six heads secured Selfe a headright of 300 acres.</p>

        <figure>

            <figcaption>Map of the area surrounding Robert Selfe's grant of land. <br/>
               
            </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>Selfe received his grant of land on May 20, 1665 from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Berkeley_(governor)">Sir William Berkeley</a>, who resumed his role as Governor after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Restoration">1660 restoration</a> of King Charles II. (The delay in Selfe's arrival to the colony and the granting of land by headright was not unusual.<sup><a href="#reference3">3</a></sup>) The following text is taken from the 1665 land grant demarcating Selfe's property:<sup><a href="#reference6">6</a></sup></p>

        <blockquote>“To all—  whereas—  now know ye that I the said <strong>Sir William Berkeley Knight Governor give and grant unto Robert Selfe three hundred acres of land situated in the county of Westmoreland</strong> on the northeast side of a swamp called Bloys Swamp; <br/><br/>Beginning at a marked white oak which divideth this from the land of Vincent Cox, and extending thence north-east one hundred and seventy-three poles to a marked red oak, thence north-west two hundred and seventy eight poles to a marked white oak, thence south-west one hundred and seventy three poles to a marked red oak, thence south-east two hundred and seventy eight poles to the place where it began. <br/><br/><strong>The said land being due unto the said Robert Selfe by and for the Transportation of six Persons.</strong>”

        </blockquote>

        <p>As the map above shows, Selfe had a number of neighbors, including Vincent Cox who himself had also attained a parcel by headright for the transportation of 8 persons, totaling 400 acres (I was unable to source Cox's other 665-acre parcel).</p>

        <p>Another nearby landowner was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lee_I">Richard Lee I</a> (1618–1664), who immigrated from England and began a dynasty of American statesmen. His grandson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lee_(Virginia_colonist)">Thomas Lee</a> (1690–1750) was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and later served as acting Governor; and his great-grandson <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee">Richard Henry Lee</a> (1732–1794) became a U.S. founding father who signed the Declaration of Independence, known for his call to pass the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Resolution">Lee Resolution</a> at the Second Continental Congress on July 2, 1776, asserting that the 13 colonies were "free and independent States."</p>

            <p>While no records exist, Yeocomico church claims that Richard Henry Lee and George Washington were likely baptized on there on April 5, 1732 (The guardian of Washington’s mother and the father of Lee were Cople Parish wardens).<sup><a href="#reference1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p>Robert Selfe died on March 27, 1717. If the 1630 birthdate is accurate, that would make him around 87 years old at death. His remains are believed to be buried the Yeocomico church cemetery— an Episcopal church neighboring his property. On January 17, 2021 Anysja Roberts and I drove down Route 606, finding the church just south-west of Tucker Hill.</p>

        <h3>Yeocomico Church</h3>

        <p>The first iteration of the church was a wooden structure built in 1655 within Northumberland parish. Then in May of 1664— one year before Selfe was granted his headright— Westmoreland County established Cople Parish to encompass Yeocomico church.<sup><a href="#reference1">1</a></sup> More likely than not, Selfe and his family attended this church throughout their lives.</p>

            <p>In 1706, a half century after the wooden church was built, a newer brick version was completed with archeological evidence suggesting that it was constructed around the frame of the original. Multiple renovations have occurred since the brick building's completion, including in the 1820s, 1873, 1928, and 2006.<sup><a href="#reference1">1</a></sup> In 1969 the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places.<sup><a href="#reference4">4</a></sup></p>

        <p>The church had a flyer of information posted at its entrance,<sup><a href="#reference1">1</a></sup> with a bulletpoint calling attention to a "curious inscription" which, according to them, has never been satisfactorily explained. "There appears to be a Scottish thistle, badge of the House of Stuart. But who or what is G, M, & S?"</p>
