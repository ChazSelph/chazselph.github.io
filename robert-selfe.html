        <p>Robert Selfe was born circa 1630 to Isaacke Selfe and Mary Margaret in Melksham, England, not far from the famous Neolithic stone circles Stonehenge and Avebury. He married a woman named Mary Antsy and together they immigrated to the Virginia colony in the 1650s, by which time they both would have been in their late teens or twenties.</p>

        <p>Selfe also paid the way for six other people to immigrate, which allowed him to capitalize on Virginia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headright" target="_blank">headright</a> law supporting immigration. The law dated to November 18, 1618 when the Virginia Company set out an offer of fifty acres per "head" for the transportation expenses of another person who settled in the colony. Six heads secured Selfe a headright of 300 acres. </p>

        <p>Selfe was granted this land on May 20, 1665 by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Berkeley_(governor)">Sir William Berkeley</a>, who had resumed post as Governor after the 1660 restoration of King Charles II. (The delay in his arrival to the colony and the granting of land by headright was not unusual.)</p>

        <blockquote>“To all - whereas - now know ye that I the said <strong>Sir William Berkeley Knight Governor give and grant unto Robert Selfe three hundred acres of land situated in the county of Westmoreland</strong> on the northeast side of a swamp called Bloys Swamp; Beginning at a marked white oak which divideth this from the land of Vincent Cox, and extending thence north-east one hundred and seventy-three poles to a marked red oak, thence north-west two hundred and seventy eight poles to a marked white oak, thence south-west one hundred and seventy three poles to a marked red oak, thence south-east two hundred and seventy eight poles to the place where it began. <strong>The said land being due unto the said Robert Selfe by and for the Transportation of six Persons.</strong>”

        </blockquote>

        <p>Robert Selfe died on March 27, 1717. He is believed to be buried in the Yeocomico church cemetery adjacent to his property.</p>

        

        <h3>Yeocomico Church</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>On the seventeenth of January 2021, Anysja and I journeyed to Yeocomico church, south-west of Tucker Hill on Route 606. </p>

        <p>The first iteration of the church was a wooden structure built in 1655 within Northumberland parish. Then in May of 1664, Westmoreland County established Cople Parish, to include Yeocomico church. In 1706 a newer brick building was completed, with archeological evidence suggesting that it was constructed around the frame of the previous wooden church. Multiple renovations have occurred since the brick iteration, including in the 1820s, 1873, 1928, and 2006. In 1970 the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places.</p>

        <p>The curious inscription above the church entrance has never been satisfactorily explained. 
            There appears to be a Scottish thistle, badge of the House of Stuart. But who or what is G, M, & S?</p>

        <p>While no records exist, it is likely that George Washington and Richard Henry Lee were baptized here on April 5, 1732. The guardian of Washington’s mother and the father of Lee Cople Parish wardens.</p>
