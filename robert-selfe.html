        <p>Robert Selfe was born circa 1630 to Isaacke Selfe and Mary Margaret in Melksham, England, not far from Stonehenge and Avebury. He grew up to marry Mary Antsy, and together they immigrated to the Virginia colony in the 1650s, by which time they were likely in their twenties. The colony was still new and growing when they arrived; in 1660 the population was surveyed and included 26,070 whites and 950 blacks.<sup><a href="#reference5">5</a></sup></p>

        <p>Selfe also paid the way for 6 other people to immigrate, allowing him to capitalize on Virginia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headright" target="_blank">headright</a> law supporting immigration. The law dated to November 18, 1618 when the Virginia Company offered fifty acres per "head" for the transportation expenses of any person who settled in the colony. Six heads secured Selfe a headright of 300 acres.</p>

        <p>Selfe received his grant of land on May 20, 1665 from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Berkeley_(governor)">Sir William Berkeley</a>, who had resumed his role as Governor after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Restoration">1660 restoration</a> of King Charles II. (The delay in Selfe's arrival to the colony and the granting of land by headright was not unusual.<sup><a href="#reference3">3</a></sup>) The following text is taken from the 1665 land grant demarcating Selfe's property:<sup><a href="#reference6">6</a></sup></p>

        <blockquote>“To all - whereas - now know ye that I the said <strong>Sir William Berkeley Knight Governor give and grant unto Robert Selfe three hundred acres of land situated in the county of Westmoreland</strong> on the northeast side of a swamp called Bloys Swamp; <br/><br/>Beginning at a marked white oak which divideth this from the land of Vincent Cox, and extending thence north-east one hundred and seventy-three poles to a marked red oak, thence north-west two hundred and seventy eight poles to a marked white oak, thence south-west one hundred and seventy three poles to a marked red oak, thence south-east two hundred and seventy eight poles to the place where it began. <br/><br/><strong>The said land being due unto the said Robert Selfe by and for the Transportation of six Persons.</strong>”

        </blockquote>

        <p>Robert Selfe died on March 27, 1717. If the 1630 birthdate is accurate, that would make him around 87 years old at death. His remains are believed to be buried adjacent to the 300 acre land grant in the Yeocomico church cemetery. On January 17, 2021 Anysja Roberts and I visited this church-- off Route 606 south-west of Tucker Hill.</p>

        <h3>Yeocomico Church</h3>

        <p>The first iteration of the church was a wooden structure built in 1655 within Northumberland parish. Then in May of 1664-- one year before Selfe was granted his headright-- Westmoreland County established Cople Parish to encompass Yeocomico church. More likely than not, Selfe and his family attended this church throughout their lives.</p>

            <p>In 1706, fifty-one years after the wooden church was built, a newer brick version was completed, with archeological evidence suggesting that it was constructed around the frame of the original. Multiple renovations have occurred since the brick building's completion, including in the 1820s, 1873, 1928, and 2006. In 1969 the church was added to the National Register of Historic Places.<sup><a href="#reference4">4</a></sup></p>

        <p>The curious inscription above the church entrance has never been satisfactorily explained. 
            There appears to be a Scottish thistle, badge of the House of Stuart. But who or what is G, M, & S?</p>

        <p>While no records exist, it is likely that George Washington and Richard Henry Lee were baptized here on April 5, 1732. The guardian of Washington’s mother and the father of Lee Cople Parish wardens.</p>
